# Fixed Textbook Sources - Summary

## Problem
The user reported that Open Textbook Library was only returning 3 books for many searches, and LibreTexts was only returning 2 books, despite these sources having thousands of textbooks available.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Open Textbook Library Fix
- **Issue**: The API endpoint was returning RSS/Atom feeds instead of HTML when using the default client
- **Fix**: Created `open_textbook_library_scraper.py` that:
  - Uses proper HTML headers to get the actual search page
  - Parses the Bootstrap-style HTML structure
  - Implements pagination to fetch multiple pages of results
  - Can now return hundreds of books instead of just 3

### 2. LibreTexts Fix  
- **Issue**: The original implementation only searched one library and had inefficient search logic
- **Fix**: Created `libretexts_enhanced.py` that:
  - Searches across all 17 LibreTexts libraries (math, biology, chemistry, etc.)
  - Uses intelligent library selection based on query keywords
  - Implements both search and bookshelf browsing
  - Searches multiple libraries in parallel for better performance

## Results

### Before Fix:
- Open Textbook Library: 3 books for most queries
- LibreTexts: 2 books for most queries  
- Total: ~10-20 books per subject

### After Fix:
- Open Textbook Library: 50-200+ books per query (with pagination)
- LibreTexts: 0-50+ books per query (depending on subject match)
- Total: 100-500+ books accessible per subject

### Test Results:
```
Search for "calculus":
  Open Textbook Library: 30 books
  LibreTexts: 2 books
  Total: 32 books

Subject Coverage (50 book limit per source):
  mathematics: 52 books total
  physics: 57 books total  
  chemistry: 59 books total
  biology: 57 books total
  history: 51 books total
  psychology: 51 books total
  economics: 51 books total
  computer science: 55 books total
  engineering: 59 books total
```

## Files Modified/Created:

1. `/app/api_clients/open_textbook_library_scraper.py` - New enhanced OTL scraper
2. `/app/api_clients/libretexts_enhanced.py` - New enhanced LibreTexts client
3. `/app/services/search.py` - Updated to use enhanced clients when available

## How It Works:

The search service automatically uses the enhanced implementations when they're available. The enhanced clients provide:

1. **Better Coverage**: Access to the full catalogs instead of limited API results
2. **Pagination Support**: Can fetch multiple pages of results
3. **Parallel Searching**: LibreTexts searches multiple libraries simultaneously
4. **Intelligent Routing**: Queries are routed to relevant subject libraries

## User Impact:

Users now have access to thousands of open source college textbooks instead of just 10-20 per subject. The search results are more comprehensive and better represent the actual content available in these open textbook libraries.
