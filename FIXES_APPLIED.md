# OpenScholar Backend Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. ERIC API Validation Error (CRITICAL)
- **Fixed**: `eric.py` now properly handles `publicationtype` field as both list and string
- **Result**: No more Pydantic validation errors from ERIC API

### 2. DOAJ API 404 Errors
- **Fixed**: Added proper 404 handling in `doaj.py`
- **Result**: DOAJ failures won't crash the search, will gracefully skip

### 3. Semantic Scholar Rate Limiting
- **Fixed**: Added rate limiting with 1-second delays between requests
- **Result**: Should reduce 429 rate limit errors significantly

### 4. Search Timeouts
- **Fixed**: Increased overall timeout from 30s to 45s
- **Result**: More reliable search completion

### 5. Configuration
- **Added**: `.env` file with proper configuration template
- **Added**: Debug test script to check individual APIs

## üîß Next Steps (Required)

### 1. Get CORE API Key
CORE API is returning 401 errors because there's no API key configured.

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://core.ac.uk/services/api/
2. Register for a free API key
3. Replace `your_core_api_key_here` in `.env` with your actual key

### 2. Test the Fixes
Run the debug script to test each API:

```bash
cd /Users/tristonmiller/Desktop/SwiftBarPlugins1/OpenScholar
python test_apis_debug.py
```

### 3. Start the Server
After getting the CORE API key, restart your server:

```bash
cd /Users/tristonmiller/Desktop/SwiftBarPlugins1/OpenScholar
python run.py
```

## üìä Expected Results

After applying these fixes, you should see:

- ‚úÖ No more ERIC validation errors
- ‚úÖ Graceful DOAJ failures (if API is down)
- ‚úÖ Reduced Semantic Scholar rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Longer timeout for slow APIs
- ‚ùå CORE API still failing until you get an API key

## üö® Critical Priority

**Get the CORE API key immediately** - this will fix the biggest source of errors (401 Unauthorized).

## üìù Monitoring

Watch your logs for these improvements:
- No more "Error normalizing ERIC paper" messages
- "DOAJ API endpoint not available" warnings instead of crashes
- Fewer "429" rate limit errors from Semantic Scholar
- Longer search completion times but fewer timeouts

The application should be much more stable after these fixes!
