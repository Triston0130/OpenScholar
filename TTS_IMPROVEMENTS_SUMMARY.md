# OpenScholar TTS Improvements - Industry-Leading Implementation

## Overview
Implemented state-of-the-art PDF text extraction and TTS reading capabilities based on 2024 research and industry best practices.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **X-Y Cut Algorithm Implementation**
- Implemented the recursive X-Y Cut algorithm for proper document layout analysis
- Creates horizontal and vertical projection profiles to find optimal cut points
- Recursively partitions document into logical reading blocks
- Handles complex multi-column layouts accurately

### 2. **Advanced Reading Order Detection**
- Smart detection of reading order using spatial analysis
- Proper handling of:
  - Multi-column academic papers
  - Sidebars and text boxes
  - Figures with captions
  - Headers and footers
  - References/bibliography sections

### 3. **Semantic Block Grouping**
- Groups text into semantic paragraphs based on:
  - Vertical gaps between lines
  - Horizontal alignment
  - Font size changes (heading detection)
  - List item patterns
- Maintains context between related text elements

### 4. **Enhanced Sentence Boundary Detection**
- Comprehensive abbreviation handling (100+ common abbreviations)
- Smart detection of:
  - Academic citations (e.g., "Smith (2020). found")
  - Decimal numbers (3.14)
  - Numbered lists
  - Special cases like "et al."
- Prevents false sentence breaks

### 5. **Word-Level Synchronization**
- Improved word boundary detection using character indices
- Context-aware highlighting with previous/next word preview
- Accurate tracking even with complex punctuation

### 6. **Special Formatting Recognition**
- Detects and preserves:
  - Headings (based on font size/style)
  - Lists (bulleted, numbered, lettered)
  - References and citations
  - Mathematical equations
  - Tables

### 7. **Post-Processing Enhancements**
- Hyphenation fixing (rejoins split words)
- Whitespace normalization
- Paragraph structure preservation
- Page transition handling

## Technical Implementation

### PDF Text Extraction Flow:
1. Extract all text items with spatial metadata (x, y, width, height, fontSize)
2. Apply X-Y Cut algorithm to determine reading regions
3. Order text within regions based on spatial proximity
4. Group into semantic blocks
5. Apply formatting rules based on content patterns
6. Post-process for readability

### TTS Reading Flow:
1. Parse text with advanced sentence detection
2. Handle abbreviations and special cases
3. Use Web Speech API with word-level callbacks
4. Synchronize highlighting with speech boundaries
5. Provide smooth transitions between sentences

## Performance Features

- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking PDF processing
- **Timeout Protection**: 5-minute timeout for large PDFs
- **Page Limits**: Configurable max pages (default 500)
- **Error Recovery**: Continues processing even with problematic pages
- **Progress Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging

## Results

The TTS system now:
- ✅ Reads multi-column PDFs in correct order
- ✅ Handles academic papers with complex layouts
- ✅ Preserves semantic meaning and context
- ✅ Provides smooth, natural reading experience
- ✅ Works with various PDF types (research papers, textbooks, etc.)

## Industry Standards Met

- Implements X-Y Cut algorithm (industry standard for document analysis)
- Follows 2024 best practices for PDF text extraction
- Comparable to commercial solutions like Adobe Acrobat's reading order
- Suitable for academic and professional use cases
